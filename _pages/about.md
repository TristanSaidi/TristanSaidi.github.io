I am PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University, fortunate to be working with Professor [Arun Kuchibhotla](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/). Before that, I completed my first year of graduate studies at Columbia University in the department of Computer Science, where I was able to work with Professor [Andrew J. Blumberg](https://cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/andrew-j-blumberg-phd) and Professor [Matei Ciocarlie](https://www.me.columbia.edu/faculty/matei-ciocarlie). During this time, I worked on theoretically grounded methods that use discrete graph curvature to improve geometric data analysis. Before that, I worked primarily on robot learning for dexterous manipulation and spent some time working on reinforcement learning for snake locomotion as well.
